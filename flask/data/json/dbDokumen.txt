["\n\nThe third typhoon to hit the storm-battered Philippines in as many weeks caused major flooding in Manila on Thursday, trapping some people on rooftops and claiming at least one life in another part of the country.\nTyphoon Vamco packed winds of up to 155 kilometers (96 miles) per hour as it swept across Luzon after making landfall overnight, with authorities warning of landslides and potentially deadly storm surges along the coast.\nHeavy rain effectively shut down Manila, the sprawling capital of 12 million people, and surrounding areas.\n\n\n\n\"A lot of places are submerged. Many people are crying for help,\" said Rouel Santos, 53, a retired disaster officer in Rizal province, next to Manila.\nSantos said the flooding caused by Vamco brought back memories of the devastating Typhoon Ketsana, known in the Philippines as Tropical Storm Ondoy, that hit in 2009 and claimed hundreds of lives.\nAt least one person died and three others were missing in Camarines Norte province, the country's Office of Civil Defense said late Wednesday.\nThe weather service warned of life-threatening storm surges several meters (feet) high along parts of the coast, including in Manila, that could inundate low-lying areas.\n\n\n\nThe Bicol region, which Vamco grazed before making landfall, was hit by powerful winds and heavy rain on Wednesday as the eye of the typhoon neared the disaster-prone archipelago.\u00a0\nThe area, which includes Catanduanes Island, is still reeling from deadly typhoons Molave and Goni, which killed dozens of people and destroyed tens of thousands of homes.\nSwathes of Bicol remain without power and with only limited or no telecommunication services after Goni - the most powerful typhoon so far this year - toppled power lines, flattened houses and flooded roads.\nThe Philippines is hit by an average of 20 storms and\u00a0typhoons every year, which typically wipe out harvests, homes and infrastructure in already impoverished areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "\n\nAn Indonesian migrant worker from Medan, North Sumatra, was found dead by the Sarawak River in Malaysia, the result of a suspected crocodile attack.\nA plywood factory in Miri reported on Oct. 30 that one of its workers, 22-year-old Muhammad Sopyan Nasution from Medan, had gone missing, according to The Star.\nAuthorities found his body in a stream near the plywood factory in the Kuala Baram industrial area on Oct. 31.\n\n\n\nThe local fire and rescue department said that one of Sopyan\u2019s friends \u201csaw him being snatched by a crocodile [\u2026] while walking along a water pipeline\u201d, The Star reported.\nRead also: Fisherman\u2019s body retrieved from crocodile\u2019s jaws in North Sumatra\nAn Indonesian agency for migrant workers has confirmed the incident.\n\u201c[Sopyan] was playing around the river on his day off.

safeguard its maritime sovereignty\" in the North Natuna Sea.\n\"I'm looking forward to cooperating together in the new ways to ensure maritime security and protect some of the world's busiest trade

overlaps slightly with China's self-proclaimed \"nine-dash\" line that demarcates its expansive claims in the South China Sea.\n\"All law-abiding nations reject the unlawful claims made by the Chinese Communist Party in the South China Sea, as it's clear from Indonesia's courageous leadership on the subject within ASEAN and at the United Nations,\" Pompeo said, referring to the 10-member grouping Association of Southeast Asian Nations.\n\"It's a cause worth pursuing in multilateral settings, and the Trump administration very much supports this,\" he added.\nRetno did not mention China directly but stressed that \"the South China Sea should be maintained as a stable and peaceful sea.\"\n\"International laws...must be respected and implemented (and) therefore, any claims should be based on universally recognized principles of international law,\" she said.\nThe North Natuna Sea is located north of the Natuna Islands, a remote archipelago that China officially recognizes as Indonesian

But, with the country facing a third wave of the coronavirus, voters are wary of risking infection to head to the polls, thus the move to declare a state of emergency.\nMuhyiddin's grip on power is tenuous as he holds razor-thin support from only 113 lawmakers out of the 222 in the House of Representatives, the lower house of the parliament, but the palace is throwing him a lifeline.\nKing Abdullah Ri'ayatuddin warned lawmakers to stop undermining the current government and signaled to them to support the proposed budget for next year.\n\"Al-Sultan Abdullah also viewed that there is no need for any Members of Parliament to continue with their irresponsible action that could threaten the stability of the current government,\" Ahmad Fadil said.\n\"His Majesty stressed that the 2021 budget that will be tabled in the parliament is very important to the people in tackling the COVID-19 pandemic and for economic recovery,\" he added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "\n\nThe Philippine capital Manila on Friday cancelled an annual procession of a centuries-old black wooden statue of Jesus Christ that draws millions of Roman Catholic devotees as the coronavirus pandemic continues to afflict the country.\nThe Philippines, renowned for its colourful religious rituals, has the second-highest number of novel coronavirus infections and deaths in Southeast Asia behind Indonesia.\n\"The grand procession of the life-sized image of the Black Nazarene in January 2021 has been cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic,\" the city government of Manila said in a statement.\n\n\n\nMillions of devotees, mostly in yellow and maroon shirts and walking barefoot, typically jostle to draw near a carriage bearing the life-sized image of the \"Black Nazarene\" shouldering a heavy cross.

application process and Singapore\u2019s safe travel pass [application process],\u201d Retno said.\n\n\n\nShe added that the travel corridor was limited to pressing diplomatic and business trips and did not cover tourism.\nAccording to the ministry, Indonesian citizens seeking to enter Singapore via the corridor will be required to have official sponsors from Singaporean state agencies and enterprises, in addition to a safe travel pass.\nLikewise, Singaporean nationals traveling to Indonesia will be obliged to have official sponsors from Indonesian state departments and business entities, in addition to a visa.\nRead also: Indonesia doubles down on ASEAN travel corridor despite being slapped with bans\n\n\n\nThe agreement has established two routes for the travel corridor, one between Soekarno-Hatta International Airport and Changi International Airport and the other between the Batam Ferry Terminal and the Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal.\nThe two nations have agreed to certain procedures to ensure adherence to health protocols, Retno said.\nFor instance, travelers are required to take two polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests \u2013 one within 72 hours before departure and one upon arrival at the airport or ferry terminal.\n\u201cThe pre-departure test results are to be released by mutually recognized healthcare institutions,\u201d Retno added.\nThe Indonesian government previously established travel corridors with the United Arab Emirates and South Korea to grant leeway to state departments and businesses from both countries, allowing them to reconnect and resume projects that were halted as a result the pandemic while still complying with health procedures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "\n\nCambodia has razed a US-funded defence facility on its southern coast, the deputy prime minister confirmed Sunday, the latest move in the ongoing controversial expansion of a strategically crucial naval base being developed with Chinese aid.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported last year on a secret draft deal allowing China to dock warships at the Ream naval base near the kingdom's coastal city of Sihanoukville.\u00a0\nBut Cambodia -- awash in recent years with Chinese investments -- has strenuously denied the report, although strongman premier Hun Sen has said aid from Beijing will fund the naval base's development.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSatellite images released by the Center for Strategic and International Studies this week showed a US-funded facility on Ream's naval base had been demolished, raising questions \"about rumoured Chinese access\", said the Washington-based think tank.\u00a0\nBut Tea Banh, Cambodia's deputy prime minister and defence minister, dismissed concerns Sunday.\u00a0\n\"We relocated the facility to a new spot. We cannot keep it anymore and the building is already old,\" he told AFP, confirming that it was knocked down last month.\u00a0\nThe Tactical Headquarters of the National Committee for Maritime Security was inaugurated in 2012.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIt will be \"far better\" in its new location, Tea Banh said, adding that Cambodia used \"only a small assistance\" from the US for the now-demolished building.\nThe new facility is currently under construction about 30 kilometres (18 miles) north of Ream.\u00a0\nThe Ream base has generated scrutiny for its strategic location in the Gulf of Thailand, which would provide ready access to the fiercely contested South China Sea -- a key global shipping route.\nBeijing claims the majority of the resource-rich sea, vying with six other countries.\nHun Sen has repeatedly insisted Cambodia's constitution forbids any foreign military base within its borders.\u00a0\nAnalysts say the wily premier is deeply attuned to the potential for an anti-China backlash from the public -- especially in Sihanoukville, where businesses and casinos are largely now Chinese-owned.\u00a0\nOne of the world's longest-serving leaders, Hun Sen has in recent years tilted away from the US due to Washington's criticism of his government's alleged abuses.\u00a0\nOn Saturday night, he issued a public letter wishing US President Donald Trump a \"speedy recovery\" from the coronavirus.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "\n\nMalaysia will not re-impose widespread novel coronavirus restrictions on travel despite a recent spike in infections, which a government minister said was partly caused by migrants from neighbouring countries.\nMalaysia imposed a nationwide lockdown in March but has been gradually lifting the curbs, though authorities have warned that they could be reinstated if daily increases in infections reached triple-digits.\nThe Southeast Asian country has seen a steady climb in cases in the past week and on Friday reported 287 new infections, the highest daily rise since it began tracking the pandemic.\n\n\n\nBut security minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob said the government did not see the need to reimpose the lockdown as the majority of cases were being reported in detention centres and isolated districts.\n\"There's only one or two cases in each state so it's not something that's worrying at this point,\" Ismail told reporters.\nThe government has come under criticism for the increase in cases, many of which have been in or linked to the second-largest state of Sabah, on Borneo island, which held an election last week.\nSeveral politicians have been accused of violating social distancing protocols on the campaign trail, while authorities were criticised for not imposing control measures such as a mandatory 14-day quarantine for travellers from Sabah.\n\n\n\nIsmail said the Sabah outbreak stemmed from the illegal entry of migrants. The government would increase resources and personnel to guard the state's borders, he said.\n\"The cases in neighbouring countries have gone up and the entry of illegal migrants from there have impacted on our efforts to control the spread of COVID-19,\" he said.\nMalaysia has avoided the level of outbreaks seen in neighbours the Philippines and Indonesia, which have 319,330 and 299,506 cases respectively.\nMalaysia has reported a total of 11,771 infections, with 136 deaths.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "\n\nPolice and soldiers in the Philippines searched for dozens of people still missing on Thursday after Typhoon Vamco killed at least 39 people and caused some of the worst flooding in years in the capital Manila and nearby provinces.\nVamco, the 21st and most deadly cyclone to hit the country this year, tore through the main island of Luzon late on Wednesday and early Thursday, just as the country was reeling from Goni, the world's strongest typhoon of 2020, which killed 25 people and flattened thousands of homes.\nRetrieval operations found 39 bodies while the search continues for 22 missing people, army chief Gilbert Gapay told a news conference.\n\n\n\nSuccessive typhoons - eight in the past two months - add to the challenges on a government battling community coronavirus infections and an economic recession.\nAmong the casualties, two men drowned and a child was killed in a landslide in Camarines province. Three people died when a warehouse collapsed in Cavite province.\nThe casualty count is subject to validation by local officials and the disaster agency, which has so far recorded 14 deaths and three missing.\nTens of thousands of homes were submerged, although water levels started to recede in parts of the badly hit Marikina suburb, allowing residents to start cleanups after returning to homes covered in debris and caked in mud.\n\n\n\n\"We don't know how to start cleaning. Mud is so thick up to the second floor,\" Gilbert Gaston, a Marikina resident, told DZMM radio.\nMany residents took refuge on rooftops and were among some 6,000 people rescued across Manila's suburbs. Government agencies were clearing landslides and debris elsewhere, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said.\nAbout 500,000 households in and around the capital were without power and virtual classes and government work was suspended in Luzon, home to half of the Philippines' 108 million population.\nVamco was approaching central Vietnam, where devastating floods and mudslides since early October have killed at least 160 people.

Biden is also winning the popular vote by more than 5.2 million votes, or 3.4 percentage points.\nWith a few states still counting votes, the electoral math is daunting for Trump. The Republican president has repeatedly claimed the election was marred by widespread fraud, with no evidence to support his assertions. He would need to overtake Biden in at least three battleground states where Biden currently leads by varying margins.\n\n\n\nThe Trump campaign has filed lawsuits challenging the vote counts in individual states, although some have already been thrown out by judges. Legal experts have said the litigation stands little chance of altering the outcome, and state election officials have said they see no evidence of serious irregularities or fraud.\nHand-count audits in more than six Arizona counties, including Maricopa County, where a majority of the state's residents live, found only minor discrepancies, the secretary of state's office reported earlier on Thursday. The audits involve hand counts of a random sampling of ballots.\nThus far, most Republican officials and lawmakers have publicly backed Trump's attempt to contest the election results and declined to recognize Biden as the president-elect.\nBut a handful of Republican senators on Thursday urged the Trump administration to allow Biden to receive intelligence briefings, implicitly acknowledging he could eventually occupy the White House even as they refused to recognize his win.\n\n\n\nThe president-elect traditionally receives such briefings from the intelligence community to learn of threats facing the United States before taking office.\n\"I don't see it as a high-risk proposition. I just think it's part of the transition. And, if in fact he does win in the end, I think they need to be able to hit the ground running,\" Senator John Cornyn told reporters.\nOther Republican senators also said Biden should have access to classified briefings, including Lindsey Graham, a vocal Trump supporter, as well as Ron Johnson, James Lankford and Chuck Grassley.\nThe top House Republican, Kevin McCarthy, opposed the idea.\n\"He's not president right now. I don't know if he'll be president January 20th,\" McCarthy said.\nBiden remained focused on preparing to govern. The former vice president, who is set to become America's second Roman Catholic president, following John F.

But its reputation abroad has collapsed due to accusations of genocide against the country's Rohingya Muslim minority, which it denies.\nThe main opposition party, the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), had won 24 seats, according to the partial official results.\nThe USDP raised objections on Wednesday and demanded a new vote as soon as possible \"in order to have an election that is free, fair, unbiased and free from unfair campaigning\".\nA USDP spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment on Friday.\nInternational and domestic observers said the vote went smoothly and without major irregularities.\nThe election commission on Wednesday said any allegations of irregularities were from a minority of participants.\nThe NLD has also demanded proof of wrongdoing, while the military, in an earlier statement, said the election had been carried out successfully.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "\n\nSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman pledged Thursday to strike extremists with an \"iron fist\", \u00a0after a bombing against a gathering of Western diplomats was claimed by the Islamic State group.\nThe bomb blast struck a World War I commemoration at a non-Muslim cemetery in Jeddah on Wednesday, just two weeks after a guard at the French consulate in the Red Sea city was wounded by a knife-wielding Saudi citizen.\nThe attacks, which underscore Muslim fury over French satirical cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, come as Saudi Arabia prepares for the G20 leaders' summit later this month - the first to be hosted by an Arab nation.\n\n\n\n\"We will continue to confront any extremist... behavior and ideas,\" Prince Mohammed said in an address to the Shura Council, the top government advisory body.\n\"We will continue to strike with an iron fist against all those who want to harm our security and stability,\" he said, according to the transcript of his speech published by the official Saudi Press Agency.\nPrince Mohammed, the kingdom's de facto ruler, warned those seeking to carry out jihadist acts of a \"painful and severe punishment\".\nWednesday's attack in Jeddah left at least two people wounded, including a Greek policeman and a Saudi official.\n\n\n\nA British citizen was also believed to have been wounded.\nDiplomats from France, Greece, Italy, Britain and the United States attended the Armistice Day commemoration ceremony in Jeddah, their embassies said.\nThe Islamic State group on Thursday claimed responsibility for the bombing, saying it was to protest the cartoons printed by the satirical French magazine Charlie Hebdo.\nA statement by IS's propaganda arm Amaq said the attack \"primarily targeted the French consul\".\nThe group offered no evidence of its involvement.\nIn a separate incident on Thursday, Dutch police arrested a man after multiple shots were fired at the Saudi embassy in The Hague, causing damage but no injuries.\nIt was not clear whether the incident, which the Saudi government condemned as \"cowardly\", was linked to the attacks in the kingdom.\nThe French embassy in Riyadh, meanwhile, has urged its nationals in Saudi Arabia to exercise \"extreme vigilance\".\nThe warning followed an attack at the Jeddah consulate on Oct.29, the same day a knife-wielding man killed three people at a church in Nice in southern France.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has vigorously defended the right to publish cartoons, but he has also tried to assuage Muslim fury over his remarks.\nMacron's stance has prompted protests in several countries at which portraits of France's president were burnt, and a campaign to boycott French products.\nSaudi Arabia - home to Islam's holiest sites - has criticized the cartoons, saying it rejected \"any attempt to link Islam and terrorism\".\nIn his speech, Prince Mohammed said he hopes \"the world will stop attacking religious symbols under the slogan of freedom of expression\" as that creates a \"fertile environment for extremism and terrorism\".\nSaudi Arabia, long\u00a0accused of exporting its ultra-conservative Wahhabist Sunni doctrine around the world, is itself a victim of domestic terror attacks.\nPrince Mohammed, who pledged in 2017 to return Saudi Arabia to an \"open, moderate Islam\", has sought\u00a0to roll back the influence of the ultra-conservative religious establishment.\n\"Extremism is no longer tolerated in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia,\" Prince Mohammed said in his speech.\nThe heir to the Saudi throne has curbed the influence of the once-powerful religious police, as he permits mixed-gender music concerts, cinemas and other entertainment options that appeal to a majority young population.\nBut simultaneously, the prince has launched a sweeping crackdown on dissent and free speech, arresting women activists, clerics and journalists as well as royal family members.\nSaudi Arabia is also grappling with a sharp coronavirus-led economic downturn, which has triggered unpopular austerity measures, including the tripling of its value added tax and the suspension of a monthly allowance to state employees.\nWhile acknowledging the \"great pain\" caused by the austerity drive, Prince Mohammed spoke of government efforts to tackle high unemployment and fight rampant corruption.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "\n\nPeruvian interim President Manuel Merino called for calm as he swore his new cabinet on Thursday amid protests that have escalated around the country since the abrupt ouster of former leader Martin Vizcarra\nMerino, whose cabinet was filled with mostly technocrats, accused some \"candidates\" planning to run in 2021 elections of inciting protests that have broken out in Lima and other cities and urged Peruvians to maintain peace.\n\"We respect those who have a dissenting opinion, but we call for calm and responsibility so that any political expression is given within the scope of tranquility and non-violence,\" Merino said in a speech after the swearing-in of his cabinet of 18 officials.\n\n\n\nMerino assumed office on Tuesday after the Andean nation's fractured Congress voted to oust Vizcarra over bribery allegations. The political shakeup comes as Peru, pummeled by the coronavirus pandemic, is bracing for its worst economic contraction in a century.\nMerino appointed Jose Arista, a former farms minister and deputy finance minister to the key economy portfolio. Carlos Herrera was appointed to the powerful energy and mining ministry after already served twice in the post.\n\"We are not going to produce any traumatic change, the state must continue to function and respect the professional and technical work in all areas,\" Merino said.\nCrowds of hundreds have gathered in the streets for days to protest the Congress vote, with dozens of demonstrators detained after clashes with police who have at times used tear gas. Plans for new protests on Thursday circulated on social media.\n\n\n\nHuman rights organizations including Amnesty International and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights have raised concerns about police using excessive force with protesters and journalists.\nThe Organization of American States (OAS) also expressed concern on Wednesday over the \"new political crisis in Peru,\" urging the country's Constitutional Court to weigh in.\nVizcarra, arriving at a prosecutor's office that is investigating him, said that protests reflected people's dissatisfaction with the situation.

It added that one American MFO member survived and was medically evacuated.\nAn earlier statement had said that eight peacekeepers were killed, including six Americans.\n\n\n\nAn official briefed on the incident, who could not be identified by name or nationality, told Reuters it was an accident caused by mechanical failure.\nThe Czech Defense Ministry released a statement confirming a Czech army member was among those killed in the helicopter crash. The statement said the cause of the crash was a technical fault.\nIn a tweet, the US Defense Department said its initial report of six service members was incorrect and that five US service members had been killed and one hospitalized.\nThe Israeli military said it evacuated the injured peacekeeper to a hospital in Israel.\n\n\n\nThe MFO was installed to monitor the demilitarization of the Sinai under the 1979 Egyptian-Israeli peace accord. It has decreased in size in recent years as the neighboring countries tightened security cooperation against Islamist-led Sinai insurgents.\nHowever both Israel and Egypt have, in the past, opposed proposals by Washington to reduce US participation in the MFO, whose website lists some 452 Americans among the force's 1,154 military personnel.\nCairo sees the MFO as part of a relationship with Israel that, while unpopular with many Egyptians, has brought it billions of dollars in U.S. defense aid, sweetening the foreign-enforced demilitarization of its sovereign Sinai territory.\nFor Israel, the MFO offers strategic reassurance in a region where allegiances can shift. In a statement of condolence, Israeli Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi described the MFO as \"extremely important ... to maintaining security and stability\".\nThe MFO statement said the helicopter was on a \"routine\" mission when it crashed. The Israeli military said in a statement it had offered to send a rescue team to the scene.\nAccording to its website, the MFO draws personnel from 13 countries and covers an area of more than 10,000 square kilometers (3,860 square miles) in the Sinai.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "\n\nMore Republican lawmakers said on Thursday the Trump administration should allow Joe Biden to receive intelligence briefings, in a tacit acknowledgement the Democrat may soon occupy the White House despite the president's refusal to concede.\nMost Republican officials and lawmakers have publicly supported President Donald Trump's effort to overturn the election results via a series of lawsuits filed in individual states, following the president's unfounded claims of widespread voting fraud.\nBiden, meanwhile, has been moving ahead with the work of preparing to govern, and spoke with Pope Francis as his fellow Democrats in Congress blasted Republican election \"shenanigans\" and urged action on the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\n\nWith a few states still counting ballots, Biden has won enough election battleground states to surpass the 270 electoral votes needed in the state-by-state Electoral College that determines the next president.

With them goes Beirut's proud reputation as the medical capital of the Middle East.\n\"This is a mass exodus,\" said Boulos, Associate Professor of Clinical Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at the American University of Beirut (AUB).\n\"It will keep on going,\" he told Reuters. \"If I had hope I would have stayed but I have no hope - not in the near nor in the intermediate future - for Lebanon.\"\nAs he spoke at his mountain residence in Beit Mery, a forested area with sweeping views over Beirut, his wife helped pack up their last possessions, ready to return to the United States.\n\n\n\nSuitcases lined the hallway, and one of his daughters was online saying final farewells to school friends and her teacher.\n\"It breaks my heart.

Anthony Blinken, a diplomat and longtime confidant of Biden is seen as a likely pick for Secretary of State or National Security Adviser, both key roles for Asian allies.\nSpeaking to South Korea's Moon, Biden reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to defend South Korea, highlighting the Asian ally as a \"lynchpin of the security and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific region,\" Moon's spokesman Kang Min-seok said.\n\"President Moon asked for close cooperation for the forward-looking development of the bilateral alliance, and the denuclearisation and peace on the Korean peninsula,\" Kang told a briefing. \"President-elect Biden said he would closely cooperate to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue.\"\nTrump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vowed to work towards denuclearisation at their unprecedented summit in 2018, but little progress has been made since their second summit and working-level talks collapsed last year.\nWhile Biden has said he would not meet with Kim without preconditions, he has also said he would embrace \"principled diplomacy\" with North Korea.\nSouth Korean officials are also hopeful that Biden will quickly resolve a drawn-out, multi-billion dollar dispute with Washington over the cost of thousands of US troops on the peninsula.\nTackling the global coronavirus pandemic and climate change were key themes in Biden's calls with all three leaders, readouts from Biden's office showed.\nAustralia's Morrison said he spoke with Biden about emission reduction technology, though a target for zero net emissions by 2050 was not discussed.\n\"I raised with the president-elect the similarity between the president-elect's comments and policies regarding emissions reduction technologies that we needed to achieve that, and we look forward to working on those issues,\" Morrison told reporters in Canberra.\nBoth Moon and Suga said they agreed to arrange summits with the new president shortly after his inauguration in January.\nBiden will also face the challenge of managing unresolved political and economic disputes between South Korea and Japan, which have threatened a military intelligence-sharing arrangement and complicated US efforts to counter China.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "\n\nThousands of supporters of Bolivia's ex-president Evo Morales crowded into his political stronghold Wednesday for a climactic rally to mark his triumphant return to his homeland.\nMorales arrived in Chimore, in the heart of Bolivia's coca-growing region, at the head of a cavalcade of vehicles, including some that accompanied him on a 600-mile (1,000-kilometer) homecoming tour since crossing the border from Argentina on Monday.\n\"In the past year I've never felt abandoned,\" he told the crowd, referring to his year in exile, initially in Mexico and later in Argentina.\n\n\n\nMorales fled Chimore a year ago to the day, having lost the support of the armed forces amid violent protests against his re-election to an unconstitutional fourth term.\nThe leftist former leader again accused the United States of provoking a \"coup d'etat\" because of Washington's interest in Bolivia's giant lithium reserves.\nThe former leader was to have been joined in Chimore by new President Luis Arce, his successor as head of the Movement for Socialism (MAS) party, according to the organizers of the homecoming rally.\nFormer economy minister Arce won the re-run of the annulled election last month and was inaugurated on Sunday.\n\n\n\nMorales explained away his absence by telling the crowd he was unavoidably elsewhere on state business, and was \"in the middle of organizing the public administration.\"\nSo far Arce and his ministers have kept their distance from Morales, who though popular, remains a divisive figure in Bolivia.\nMany Bolivians believe his return risks derailing the new president's stated intention to unite the country after a year of rule by a right-wing interim government.\nThe ex-president has repeatedly said he will not engage in politics, though his critics remain skeptical.\nThousands of peasant farmers and miners, almost all of them indigenous, have flocked to towns and villages on the journey to greet their returning hero, dancing to the music of brass bands and waving the multi-colored indigenous wiphala flag.\nMany of them repeated the same mantra as his cavalcade, at times numbering around 100 vehicles, swept into their villages: \"Evo is like us.\"\n\"Here are his people, he knows how to listen to the indigenous people,\" said Elizabeth Arcaide, a 43-year-old woman who wiped away tears during a rally in Orinoca, where hundreds turned out at a local football ground under a scorching sun to welcome the \"son of the people.\"\nBolivia has one of the largest indigenous populations of any Latin American country, some 41 percent of its 11.5 million population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "\n\nUS President-elect Joe Biden appointed top Democratic official Ron Klain as his chief

He was in charge of the Barack Obama administration's response to the Ebola health crisis in 2014, when Biden was vice president.\nA fierce critic of Republican President Donald Trump's handling of the novel coronavirus pandemic, Klain was expected to be a key figure in Biden's response to the health crisis.\n\n\n\n\u201cRon has been invaluable to me over the many years that we have worked together, including as we rescued the American economy from one of the worst downturns in our history in 2009 and later overcame a daunting public health emergency in 2014,\u201d Biden said in a statement.\nKlain said in a statement: \u201cIt's the honor of a lifetime to serve President-elect Biden in this role, and I am humbled by his confidence. I look forward to helping him and the Vice President-elect assemble a talented and diverse team to work in the White House.\"\nKlain was Biden's vice-presidential chief of staff and was most recently a senior advisor to Biden's presidential campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "\n\nSaudi Arabia's King Salman bin Abdulaziz urged the world on Thursday to take \"a decisive stance\" to address efforts by Iran to develop nuclear and ballistic missile programs, in an annual address to the top government advisory body.\n\"The kingdom stresses the dangers of Iran's regional project, its interference in other countries, its fostering of terrorism, its fanning the flames of sectarianism and calls for a decisive stance from the international community against Iran that guarantees a drastic handling of its efforts to obtain weapons of mass destruction and develop its ballistic missiles program,\" the king said.\nThey were the 84-year-old ruler's first public remarks since he addressed the United Nations General Assembly in September via videolink, where he also took aim at Iran. Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia and Shi'ite Iran are locked in a decades-long struggle for influence across the region, supporting opposing sides in conflicts from Syria to Yemen.\n\n\n\nThere was no immediate reaction from Iran to the king's remarks. Tehran has previously described Saudi statements against it as \"baseless allegations\" and denies arming groups in the Middle East.\nState news agency SPA published a full transcript of the king's speech after midnight. State TV carried photos of what appeared to be the king virtually addressing council members from his palace in Neom.\nKing Salman was hospitalized for several days over the summer, suffering from inflammation of the gall bladder for which he had surgery.\nTensions have risen in the region since US President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of a landmark nuclear deal with world powers in 2018 and reimposed stringent economic sanctions on the Islamic Republic.\n\n\n\nSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed's relationship with Trump had provided a buffer against international criticism over Riyadh's rights record sparked by the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Riyadh's role in Yemen's war and the detention of women activists.\nThose areas may now become points of friction with US President-elect Joe Biden, who pledged in his campaign to reassess ties with the kingdom, a major oil exporter and buyer of US arms.\nSaudi Arabia was an enthusiastic backer of Trump's \"maximum pressure\" campaign on Iran. But Biden has said he would return to a 2015 nuclear pact between world powers and Tehran, a deal negotiated when Biden was vice president in Barack Obama's administration.\nIn Yemen, where Saudi Arabia leads a military coalition battling the Iran-aligned Houthis in a nearly six year war that has killed tens of thousands, King Salman said the kingdom continues to support UN-led efforts to reach a political settlement.\nHe also condemned the Iran-aligned Houthi movement's \"deliberate and methodological\" targeting of civilians inside Saudi Arabia via drones and ballistic missiles.\nRiyadh was working to guarantee the stability of global oil supplies to serve both producers and consumers, despite Covid-19's impact on oil markets, the king said.\nHe repeated his long-standing support for a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict, but did not refer to the US-brokered agreements signed between the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Sudan to normalize ties with Israel, part of a strategic realignment against Iran.\nRiyadh has quietly acquiesced to the UAE and Bahrain deals, though it has stopped short of endorsing them, and has signaled it is not ready to take action itself.\nThe king spoke days before the Group of 20 summit, which Saudi Arabia is hosting virtually this year.\nPrince Mohammed had denied ordering Khashoggi's killing but in 2019 he acknowledged some personal accountability by saying that it happened on his watch. Riyadh has jailed eight people for between seven and 20 years in the case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "\n\nA bomb attack on a World War One remembrance ceremony in the Saudi Arabian city of Jeddah wounded several people on Wednesday, France said, urging its citizens living in the conservative kingdom to exercise maximum vigilance.\nFrance's Foreign Ministry said the attack had taken place at a ceremony in the Red Sea port city involving foreign embassies, and that an explosive device had been used. A Greek official told Reuters four people had been wounded.\n\"There was some sort of a blast at the non-Muslim cemetery in Jeddah. There are four slightly injured, among them one Greek,\" the Greek official told Reuters, declining to named.\n\n\n\n\"The embassies that were involved in the commemoration ceremony condemn this cowardly attack, which is completely unjustified,\" a French Foreign Ministry statement said.\n\"They call on the Saudi authorities to shed as much light as they can on this attack, and to identify and hunt down the perpetrators.\"\nThe French consulate in Jeddah, in a statement seen by Reuters, urged its nationals in Saudi Arabia to exercise \"maximum vigilance\" following the attack.\n\"In particular, exercise discretion, stay away from all gatherings and be cautious when moving around,\" said the statement, which was emailed to French residents in Jeddah. The statement said only two people had been injured.\n\n\n\nA source with knowledge of the matter said the attack happened early on Wednesday when several diplomatic delegations from the European Union and other countries were present at a Remembrance Day event organized by the French Embassy.\nThe Saudi government communications office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe explosion was the second security incident to take place in Jeddah in the last couple of weeks.\nOn Oct. 29 a Saudi man was arrested after attacking and wounding a security guard at the French consulate there.\nIt followed the beheading earlier in October near Paris of a French school teacher by a man of Chechen origin who had said he wanted to punish the teacher for showing pupils cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad in a civics lesson.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "\n\nThe first vaccinations in the European Union against Covid-19 could take place in the first quarter of 2021 in an optimistic scenario, the head of the EU health agency told AFP on Wednesday.\n\"I think optimistically first quarter next year, but I can't be more precise,\" Andrea Ammon, the director of the Stockholm-based European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), said in an interview.\nA European source told AFP on Tuesday that a vaccine could be authorized for use in the EU in \"early 2021\", after the announcement that US pharmaceutical group Pfizer and Germany's BioNTech's vaccine had shown 90 percent effectiveness in phase three trials.\n\n\n\n\"Of course it's promising,\" said Ammon, stressing that so far it is a \"press release and not yet a (scientific) peer review, so we have to see what the final assessment will be.\"\nAmmon said the pandemic's development in Europe was \"very, very concerning\" and all indicators \"are going in the wrong direction right now.\"\nSince the beginning of the outbreak, Europe has suffered at least 311,000 deaths from more than 13 million infections, and many countries have been hit by a second wave.\nAmmon urged Europeans to respect their countries' restrictions and measures to curb the spread of the virus, \"as hard as it may be.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "\n\nAbortion charities are reporting a sharp increase in the number of Polish women turning to them for help after a constitutional court ruling last month to tighten legislation.\nFor Ciocia Basia (Aunt Basia), a Berlin-based group helping Polish women with abortions in Germany, the ruling worsens a situation already complicated by the pandemic.\n\"We have had a high increase in callers. Three times as many as before,\" Cioca Basia volunteer Ula Bertin told AFP.\n\n\n\nThe Polish court ruling struck down a provision of the law that had allowed abortions in cases of severe fetal anomalies, triggering a wave of protests.\nEven though the verdict is not yet in force, activist groups say Polish doctors are now even more reticent to perform permitted abortions lest they fall on the wrong side of the law.\nBertin said that often women seeking help \"were already in the process of arranging an abortion in Poland and now no one wants to do it. So they're mentally exhausted, traumatized\".\n\"They're punished twice because the child they were awaiting has turned out to be sick and may not survive, but they're being forced to deliver. It's emotional torture.\"\n\n\n\nOther organizations are reporting a similar uptick in calls for help, despite the difficulties of foreign travel because of measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus.\nAbortion Without Borders (AWB), a multinational coalition, said that since the ruling it has helped 40 women travel or arrange to travel abroad for abortion - already more than double its monthly average.\nMara Clarke from AWB said the sudden increase in calls from Polish women was also due to the fact that \"protesters were chanting the name of our organization and phone number\" at the mass nationwide demonstrations.\nSince launching in December, the network has provided information on how to access pills to hundreds of Poles who then had at-home medical abortions - a grey zone in Poland, neither authorized nor banned by law.\nFor those requiring a surgical procedure, the coalition offers logistical and financial support so they can abort in Austria, Britain, Germany or the Netherlands.\nKasia Roszak, from the coalition's Dutch group Abortion Network Amsterdam, said many recent callers had abortions planned at Polish hospitals and \"were sort of left on their own\".\nSome had got referrals for the procedure but were told that no one would actually undertake it. Others saw their appointments indefinitely postponed.\n\"So they had to scramble for another solution,\" she told AFP.\nEven before the court ruling, some who qualified in Poland would contact the group after sensing that doctors were playing for time to avoid the procedure.\n\"The legal abortion process was already complicated and not very user-friendly,\" said Roszak.\nPoland has some of Europe's most restrictive abortion laws and the ruling would allow terminations only in cases of rape, incest and when the life of the mother is at stake.\nA country of 38 million, Poland sees fewer than 2,000 legal abortions every year, according to official statistics. Women's groups estimate that another 200,000 women abort illegally or abroad.\nWhen Warsaw resident Hanna was in her early 20s and not ready to start a family, she got an abortion in the Netherlands with help from relatives there.\n\"I really liked how professional it was. Because I've heard from friends about Poland's abortion underground, and it's less pleasant,\" the 38-year-old mother-of-two told AFP.\n\"There's the feeling that you're doing something illegal, that you have to visit the gynecologist on the sly at night, and the fear that if something goes wrong there's nowhere to file a complaint or to get help.\"\nBertin from Ciocia Basia said Poles will burst into tears after a check-up because they feel they have entered \"a parallel universe where the things that for them are taboo... are for us normal, simply normal\".\nWhile Poles are now getting a little help from their friends abroad, the reverse was once true: thousands of Swedes traveled to Poland for abortions in the 1960s when they were banned at home.\nPoland had unfettered access to abortion then, as today's legislation was only adopted in 1993 as part of a church-state compromise after communism.\nSwedish Gender Equality Minister Asa Lindhagen said she believes it is time to return the favor and has called for the government \"to stand up for Polish women\" and offer free, subsidized abortions.\n\"No woman should have to risk her life undergoing an illegal abortion.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "\n\nA travel bubble between Hong Kong and Singapore will begin on Nov 22, the two cities announced on Wednesday, as they moved to re-establish overseas travel links and lift the hurdle of quarantine for visiting foreigners.\nHong Kong's Commerce Secretary and Singapore's Transport Minister said the scheme would begin with one flight a day into each city, with a quota of 200 travelers per flight. This would be increased to two flights a day into each city from Dec. 7.\nIf the COVID-19 situation deteriorated in either city the travel bubble would be suspended, they said.\n\n\n\nSingapore's Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung said he believed the travel bubble was the first of its kind in the world and enabled both cities to open up borders in a controlled manner, while maintaining safety.\n\"While we may be starting small, this is an important step forward ... It will be a useful reference for other countries and regions that have controlled the epidemic, and are contemplating opening their borders.\"\nTravelers from both cities must travel on designated flights and must undertake COVID-19 tests. No quarantine would be required in either place and there would be no restrictions on the purpose of travel.\nFor Hong Kong, which has banned non-residents since March, the deal with Singapore is its first resumption of travel ties with another city. Travelers from mainland China and neighboring Macau still face 14 days in quarantine.\nSingapore already has pacts on essential business and official travel from China, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, South Korea, and opened unilaterally to general visitors from a handful of countries including Brunei, New Zealand and Vietnam.\nCathay Pacific and Singapore Airlines would be the carriers offering the initial designated travel bubble flights, according to Singapore authorities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "\n\nEuropean leaders on Tuesday mooted tightening the EU's external borders, as they vowed joint action following a spate of attacks on home soil blamed on Islamist radicals.\nPresident Emmanuel Macron, who called a summit after deadly recent acts of terror in France and Austria, called for a \"rapid and coordinated\" response and denounced what he described as the \"misuse\" of Europe's asylum provisions by people\u00a0seeking entry for sinister reasons.\n\"In all of our countries we are witnessing a misuse of the right to asylum\" by traffickers, criminal gangs, or people from countries \"which are not at war\", the French leader told journalists after the video conference.\n\n\n\nThe meeting was called after four people were killed in a shooting rampage by a dual Austrian-Macedonian national in the heart of Vienna last week.\nA Chechen radical Islamist with asylum status beheaded a history teacher outside Paris last month, and a Tunisian who came to France on a migrant boat then killed three people at a church in Nice.\nThe crimes prompted a debate about entry control.\nAnd as European leaders vowed Tuesday to protect the Schengen zone of visa-free travel between member countries, they also talked about strengthening the common zone's borders with the outside.\n\n\n\n\"You can only can preserve it (Schengen) if we urgently, urgently focus on the external borders,\" said Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte.\nThe Netherlands, he said, supported strengthening Frontex - the agency tasked with helping EU countries and the Schengen members manage their external borders.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel, for her part, agreed it was \"urgent and crucial for us to know who enters and who leaves\" the Schengen area.\nMeeting host Macron called for better data exchanges between EU countries \"because any security gap on the external border or inside member states is a security risk for all the member states.\"\nLast week, he announced a doubling of the number of French border guards, and called for a \"deep\" revision in the Schengen area rules.\nAlso present at Tuesday's meeting were Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, European Council chief Charles Michel and EU Commission head Ursula von der Leyen, who also underscored the \"protection of external borders\" as a priority.\nKurz said\u00a0the danger of an attack \"is with us permanently\".\n\"We have among us thousands of foreign terrorist combatants who survived combat in Syria and Iraq for the Islamic State (group) and returned,\" he said.\n\"These are time bombs,\" added Kurz. \"We need to adopt a more solid approach to the threat weighing on Europe.\"\nStressing there was no conflict between Islam and Christianity, Merkel said there was, however, a strong need \"for a model of democratic society to combat terrorist and undemocratic behaviour\" in Europe.\nKey to the battle was a determined fight against \"terrorist propaganda and hate speech\" online, said Macron.\nFrench teacher Samuel Paty's beheading last month was inspired by a virulent social media campaign against him by parents after he had shown cartoons of the Prophet Mohamed to pupils in a lesson on free speech.\n\"The internet is a space of freedom, our social networks too, but this freedom exists only if there is security and if it is not the refuge of those who flout our values or seek to indoctrinate with deadly ideologies,\" said the French president.\nHe is pushing for the adoption \"in the coming weeks\" of EU regulations forcing media and websites to speedily remove \"terrorist\" propaganda that appears on their platforms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "\n\nJordanians voted Tuesday in a parliamentary election overshadowed by the coronavirus pandemic, which has dealt a heavy blow to the Arab country's already debt-ridden economy.\nMore than 50,000 security force personnel were on hand to ensure masks were worn inside polling stations and social distancing maintained.\nAuthorities ruled that the four-yearly election should go ahead, but voters who have tested positive for COVID-19 face up to a year in prison if they ignore instructions to stay home.\n\n\n\nOn the eve of polling day, the kingdom had confirmed around 115,000 infections and 1,295 deaths in its population of about 10 million.\nSome 4.5 million Jordanians are eligible to vote and turnout stood at 29.9 percent when polls closed at 9:00 pm (1900 GMT), voting having been extended for two hours due to an influx of voters.\nResults are expected on Wednesday.\nA nationwide curfew from 10:00 pm (2000 GMT) Tuesday until 6:00 am (0400 GMT) Sunday was imposed with the aim of reducing celebratory gatherings that could spread the virus.\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Bisher al-Khasawneh cast his vote in Aidoun, about 90 kilometers (55 miles) north of Amman, before telling journalists he was \"honored to have fulfilled this national duty and constitutional right\".\nHe added he hoped the election would result in \"a parliament that responds to the aspirations of the citizens\".\nParliament has limited authority in Jordan, where the king has wide powers to rule by decree.\nBut it has provided a platform for the opposition when it has not boycotted the elections.\nThis year, the largest opposition faction, the Islamic Action Front, the political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood, is fielding candidates in some seats despite the banning of its parent organisation in a Saudi-backed move earlier this year.\nIn 2016, the IAF won 16 seats in the 130-seat parliament. In 2010 and 2013, it boycotted polls.\nLeftist and Arab nationalist groups are also fielding candidates, alongside a much larger number of independents, many of them representatives of powerful tribes considered loyal to the monarchy.\n\"This vote is different, with people in greater distress because of the epidemic,\" said Oraib Rintawi of the Al-Quds Centre for Political Studies.\n\"People will vote based on tribal allegiances, for a candidate from their own clan or for one who offers to provide them services.\"\nResource-poor and dependent on foreign aid, Jordan has built up a public debt that exceeds 100 percent of GDP.\nUnemployment stood at 23 percent in the first quarter, before the pandemic had even fully hit.\n\"Let's hope the winners heed our demands,\" Jazi Mutlaq told AFP after casting her vote in the Baqa'a refugee camp, north of Amman.\n\"We have many young people out of work, people's financial situation is bad,\" the 70-year-old said.\nAcil al-Lawzi, 35, said she was worried about the impact of distance learning on children's education.\nSchools have been closed since March and many Jordanian children do not have access to the internet for online lessons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "\n\nWork to distribute the experimental COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE is gearing up after the companies announced successful interim data earlier on Monday , but it will not be coming to local pharmacies for the general public any time soon.\nThe data, which sent US stocks to record highs , showed that the two companies' experimental vaccine is 90 percent effective at preventing COVID-19. They are still awaiting data on safety, which could come later this month.\nPfizer and BioNTech need to get regulators to sign off on the shot before it can start shipping vaccines to those considered most in need by government. Healthcare workers and people living in nursing homes will likely top that list.\n\n\n\nBut the vaccine's complex and super-cold storage requirements are an obstacle for even the most sophisticated hospitals in the United States and may impact when and where it is available in rural areas or poor countries where resources are tight.\nThe main issue is that the vaccine, which is based on a novel technology that uses synthetic mRNA to activate the immune system against the virus, needs to be kept at minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94 F) or below.\n\"The cold chain is going to be one of the most challenging aspects of delivery of this vaccination,\" said Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.\n\"This will be a challenge in all settings because hospitals even in big cities do not have storage facilities for a vaccine at that ultra-low temperature.\"\n\n\n\nIndeed, one of the most prestigious US hospitals, the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, said it does not currently have that capability.\n\"We're talking about a vaccine that needs storage at minus 70 or 80. That's a tremendous logistical issue not only in the US but outside the Western world,\" said Dr Gregory Poland, a virologist and vaccine researcher with the Mayo Clinic.\n\"We're a major medical center and we don't have storage capacity like this. That will be true for everybody. This is a logistical obstacle.\"\nPfizer spokeswoman Kim Bencker said the company was working closely with the US government and state officials on how to ship the vaccine from its distribution centers in the United States, Germany and Belgium around the globe.\nThe detailed plan includes using dry ice to transport frozen vaccine vials by both air and land at their recommended temperatures for up to 10 days, she said.\nState and local healthcare providers are responsible for storing and administering vaccines once delivered.\nThey can be kept in an ultra-low temperature freezer for up to six months, or for five days at 2-8 degrees C \u2013 a type of refrigeration commonly available at hospitals, Bencker said.\nThe Pfizer storage units can also be refilled with ice for up to 15 days, she said.\nBut shots will spoil in around five days at normal refrigeration temperatures of slightly above freezing. BioNTech CEO Ugur Sahin told Reuters the companies are analyzing if they can extend that for two weeks.\nThe vaccine of Moderna Inc, which is working on a vaccine based on similar technology, does not need to be stored at such a low temperature.\nOther vaccines including ones from Johnson & Johnson and Novavax Inc can be stored at 2-8 degrees C, the temperature of a regular refrigerator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "\n\nPope Francis's former envoy to France, Luigi Ventura, goes on trial in Paris on Tuesday for sexual assault following complaints by five men who accused him of groping them during public ceremonies.\nThe allegations against the 75-year-old\u00a0Italian-born archbishop caused deep embarrassment for the Vatican, coming in the midst of a slew of revelations about clerical sex abuse that have rocked the Catholic Church.\nVentura was stripped of his diplomatic immunity last year so that he could be put on trial - a first in the history of the Holy See.\n\n\n\nHe will not attend the start of the proceedings on Tuesday afternoon due to ill health, his lawyer told AFP.\nIt was Paris city hall that first reported the cleric to the police after a 28-year-old official from the its international relations team accused Ventura of touching his buttocks three times during a New Year's ceremony in January 2019.\nFour other men later came forward with similar allegations against Ventura relating to public events in France between January 2018 and February 2019.\nThey include a senior foreign ministry official and a seminarian who accused the bishop of groping him during a mass.\n\n\n\nVentura, who had been stationed in Paris since 2009, resigned in December after reaching the 75-year age limit for the job\nHe was the pope's envoy to Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, Niger, Chile and Canada before being appointed the Vatican's representative in France.\nHis lawyer Solange Doumic had earlier told AFP that he was \"waiting impatiently for the trial so that he can explain himself, that all light be shed (on the allegations) and his innocence be proven.\"\nBut on Tuesday she said his doctor had advised him against travelling to France from Rome.\nSexual assault carries a maximum five-year prison sentence and a fine of 75,000 euros in France.\nDoumic claimed that it was Ventura himself who had asked to have his diplomatic immunity removed \"in order to be able to explain himself before the courts\".\nBut lawyers for his accusers, who have joined the criminal case as civil plaintiffs, said that they fought hard to have his immunity quashed.\nThe Catholic Church has been rocked by a wave of allegations detailing decades of sexual abuse by clerics around the world, mostly involving minors.\nPope Francis has announced a policy of zero tolerance towards offenders.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"]
