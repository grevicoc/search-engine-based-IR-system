["\n\nSoutheast Asian leaders kicked off a multilateral summit on Thursday expected to address tensions in the South China Sea and tackle plans for a post-pandemic economic recovery in a region where US-China rivalry has been rising.\nThe Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has so far not been \"drawn into the maelstroms\" of those rivalries and challenges to the international multilateral system, Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said in his opening remarks at the 37th ASEAN Summit in Hanoi.\n\"Three quarters of a century have passed since the end of the Second World War. World peace and security, however, are not yet truly sustainable,\" said Phuc, whose government holds the chairmanship of the 10-member bloc in 2020.\n\n\n\n\"This year, they are particularly under greater threat as a result of compounding risks arising from the unpredictable conduct of states, major power rivalries and frictions,\" Phuc said.\nHigh on the summit's agenda will be tensions in the South China Sea, where Chinese ships have been embroiled in periodic standoffs with vessels from Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia as Beijing seeks to assert its territorial claims in the disputed waterway.\nChina claims about 80 percent of the sea including large swathes of Vietnam's exclusive economic zone, or EEZ, as well as the Paracel Islands and Spratly Islands. It also overlaps the EEZs of ASEAN members Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines.\nSince mid-August, the United States has repeatedly riled China by sending warships to the South China Sea and has blacklisted 24 Chinese entities over their involvement in building and militarizing artificial islands.\nASEAN leaders are also expected to sign the China-backed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) on Sunday in what could become the world's biggest trade agreement.\nThe deal, which comes at a time when tensions over the U.S. election result leave questions over Washington's engagement in the region, will likely cement China's position more firmly as an economic partner with Southeast Asia, Japan and Korea, and put it in a better position to shape the region's trade rules.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "\n\nThe third typhoon to hit the storm-battered Philippines in as many weeks caused major flooding in Manila on Thursday, trapping some people on rooftops and claiming at least one life in another part of the country.\nTyphoon Vamco packed winds of up to 155 kilometers (96 miles) per hour as it swept across Luzon after making landfall overnight, with authorities warning of landslides and potentially deadly storm surges along the coast.\nHeavy rain effectively shut down Manila, the sprawling capital of 12 million people, and surrounding areas.\n\n\n\n\"A lot of places are submerged.

Anwar Ibrahim to give a statement after they received complaints about names of lawmakers appearing in news media reportedly backing his claim to the premiership.\nAnwar last week announced he had been granted an audience with King Al-Sultan Abdullah on Tuesday to present documentation \"of the strong and convincing majority\" of legislators behind his bid to replace Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin.\nPolice in a statement said they had received unspecified complaints over a widely circulated list of 121 federal lawmakers who supposedly were backing Anwar's bid.\n\n\n\nSo far there have been no significant public endorsements for Anwar.\nPolice said one of the complaints was lodged by a member of parliament but did not disclose the identities of the other complainants, or what the complaints entailed.\n\"The police urge the public not to be concerned by the spread of the news and advises all interested parties against spreading news that has yet to be verified,\" Criminal Investigations Department Director Huzir Mohamed said.\n\"The police will not hesitate to take action against those who spread news that is false, unverified and misleading.\"\nHuzir said they had initially asked Anwar to give his statement on Monday morning, but due to scheduling conflicts they will set a new date for their meeting.\nAnwar said members of his People's Justice Party have been instructed not to hold any gatherings while he attends his audience with the king.\n\"I also call upon all Malaysians to keep calm as this audience session takes place, and to remain calm for any subsequent process that takes place thereafter,\" Anwar said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "\n\nIndonesia has completed negotiations to establish a travel corridor with Singapore to facilitate urgent diplomatic missions and essential business trips between the two countries amid the ongoing COVID-19 crisis.\nForeign Minister Retno Marsudi said at a press conference on Monday that the arrangement, dubbed the Reciprocal Green Lane (RGL), would come into effect on Oct. 26.\n\u201cTrips [via the corridor] may be available within several days in accordance with Indonesia\u2019s e-visa application process and Singapore\u2019s safe travel pass [application process],\u201d Retno said.\n\n\n\nShe added that the travel corridor was limited to pressing diplomatic and business trips and did not cover tourism.\nAccording to the ministry, Indonesian citizens seeking to enter Singapore via the corridor will be required to have official sponsors from Singaporean state agencies and enterprises, in addition to a safe travel pass.\nLikewise, Singaporean nationals traveling to Indonesia will be obliged to have official sponsors from Indonesian state departments and business entities, in addition to a visa.\nRead also: Indonesia doubles down on ASEAN travel corridor despite being slapped with bans\n\n\n\nThe agreement has established two routes for the travel corridor, one between Soekarno-Hatta International Airport and Changi International Airport and the other between the Batam Ferry Terminal and the Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal.\nThe two nations have agreed to certain procedures to ensure adherence to health protocols, Retno said.\nFor instance, travelers are required to take two polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests \u2013 one within 72 hours before departure and one upon arrival at the airport or ferry terminal.\n\u201cThe pre-departure test results are to be released by mutually recognized healthcare institutions,\u201d Retno added.\nThe Indonesian government previously established travel corridors with the United Arab Emirates and South Korea to grant leeway to state departments and businesses from both countries, allowing them to

coronavirus cases in the single digits for the first time since March.\nThe city-state, which has seen cases fall sharply in recent months as it has brought outbreaks in migrant worker dormitories under control, said it had discovered just six new cases.\nOf those six, four were classed as imported cases - travellers who had been ordered to stay home on arrival into the Southeast Asian island nation.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Philippines' health ministry on Saturday reported 2,674 new coronavirus infections, the highest daily increase in five days, and 62 additional deaths.\nIn a bulletin, the

coastal areas of Nicaragua and Honduras on Monday.\nAs of 0300 GMT Sunday, Iota - the latest in an unusually busy storm season - was about 440 miles (705 kilometers) east-southeast of the Cabo Gracias a Dios on the Nicaragua-Honduras border, moving slowly westwards with maximum sustained winds of 75 miles per hour (120 kph).\nIota was upgraded to a hurricane early Sunday, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center (NHC) said.\n\n\n\n\"Reconnaissance aircraft finds Iota has strengthened into the thirteenth hurricane of the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season,\" it tweeted.\nIota is projected to hit the Colombian island of Providencia by late Sunday and is expected to rapidly strengthen into a major hurricane as it approaches Central America.\n\"It is likely that the heavy rainfall from Iota, through Thursday, will lead to life-threatening flash flooding and river flooding in parts of northern Colombia and Central America,\" the NHC warned.\n\"The flooding and mudslides in Honduras and Nicaragua may be exacerbated by the recent effects of Hurricane Eta in those areas, resulting in significant impacts.\"\n\n\n\nHonduras, Guatemala and Nicaragua announced evacuations Friday, even as the region was still reeling from the devastation inflicted by Eta.\nEta's heavy rains burst river banks and triggered landslides as far north as Chiapas, Mexico.\nThe NHC warned that Iota would deposit as much as 16 inches (40 centimeters) of rain on Honduras, northern Nicaragua, eastern Guatemala and southern Belize, with isolated totals of up to 30 inches.\nThat could lead to \"significant, life-threatening flash flooding and river flooding, along with mudslides,\" the NHC said.\nAuthorities in Honduras on Friday ordered police and the army to evacuate the area of San Pedro Sula - the country's second city and industrial capital, located 110 miles north of Tegucigalpa.\nEta hit that area hard: About 40,000 people are still in shelters across the country.\nThe government also ordered water released from Honduras's main hydroelectric dam, due to danger of it overflowing from Iota's rains.\nIn Nicaragua, authorities were preparing for \"floods, rain, high tides, wind and landslides on saturated soil,\" said Guillermo Gonzalez, head of the country's disaster response agency Sinapred.\nInitial estimates show \"some 80,000 families are going to be at risk,\" he said, with evacuations underway in communities along the border with Honduras.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "\n\nFrom Jan.1 British and EU citizens will be confronted with the reality of Brexit as the transition period ends and borders done away with decades ago return.\nFrom that date, Britons will be treated by the EU as \"third country\" nationals, no longer enjoying freedom of movement to work, study or retire across the European Union and associated states.\nBritain in turn will process EU nationals at its borders as it does other non-UK passport holders.\n\n\n\nEU citizens proving residence in Britain, or Britons already living in a European Union country, before the end of this year will theoretically retain their rights under a Withdrawal Agreement struck in late 2019.\u00a0\nTourists will see some immediate changes - apart from the evolving coronavirus restrictions already crimping travel - but both sides have agreed that travel will be visa-free, as long as the other side keeps it that way.\nBut the EU will stop British passports being used in its automated e-gates, potentially meaning longer queues at manned passport booths.\u00a0\nBritons must hold passports still valid for at least six months and will be limited to EU stays of 90 days in a rolling 180-day period.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThey will also need to show travel insurance coverage, sufficient funds and a return ticket on request.\nEuropeans entering Britain can use a national ID card until October, after which only passports will be accepted, for stays of up to six months.\nEU passport holders will be able to continue using British e-gates under current guidance.\nThose with criminal records may be banned and non-European family members of a European may need a visa, depending on nationality.\nThe UK treats Irish citizens separately from other EU nationals under a bilateral arrangement dating back nearly a century that allows continued freedom of movement between Britain and Ireland.\nEuropeans will be able to keep using EU pet passports as long as rabies vaccines are up to date.\nBorder control for business travelers is one of myriad issues yet to be worked out between the EU and the UK.\nIn the EU, Britons attending conferences or meetings likely will be exempt from visas where they do not receive payment or provide services.\nHowever for other UK business travelers, including posted workers and the self-employed, a visa and/or a work permit may be imposed in line with each individual EU country's laws.\u00a0\nThere will also be tax and social security considerations.\nCertain services or company ownership in those countries may be off-limits to non-EU citizens or residents or those lacking national licenses, and customs declarations may be needed for goods carried in.\nWithout an EU-UK deal, Britain will likely apply its current rules for those coming from favored nations, meaning a visa needed for work but not for short stays to attend a conference or training.\nThose same rules would require EU citizens with a job offer to prove English-language skills and a minimum salary dependent on whether the position is skilled (26,500 pounds, equivalent to 29,600 euros or $35,000) or a shortage occupation (20,480 pounds, 22,800 euros).\nFrom January, EU students going to Britain will need a visa for courses longer than six months, and will have to pay steeper tuition fees - four times as much for degrees such as medicine or MBAs in prestigious universities.\nUK universities fear that that hefty burden will force many European students to choose EU institutions - some of which are free - instead, blowing a big hole in their finances.\nThey also say they are already being shunned for research projects led by EU universities.\nAccording to UK parliament research, there were 143,000 EU students in British universities in the 2018 to 2019 school year.\nInternational students have made Britain the second-most popular education destination after the US, and they injected 25.8 billion pounds (29 billion euros, or $34 billion) into the UK economy in 2015.\nWithout an EU-UK deal, British students will be excluded from the Erasmus+ program offering subsidized exchanges to EU countries.\nBritish students wanting to go to EU universities will encounter higher fees in some countries as well as visa requirements that in many cases will curb their right to work.\nFor the estimated 1.3 million Britons living in the EU and the 3.6 million EU citizens living in the UK before the end of the transition period, their rights to stay are protected under the 2019 Withdrawal Agreement.\nThose wanting to emigrate elsewhere in the EU after Jan.1 will find a very different situation.\nBritons, for example, have long favored Spain, France, Germany and Italy to set down new roots as workers or retirees.\nBut the end of freedom of movement will see them having to jump through the same hoops as other \"third country\" nationals, which often include health insurance, income and language requirements.\nEven Britons settled under the Withdrawal Agreement will no longer have automatic rights to a different EU country, and will face national immigration laws if they want to do so.\nBritain, for its part, is bringing in a points-based system from 2021 that will make it significantly harder for Europeans to move there.\nAge, English language ability, funds, the requirement to pay a health surcharge will all be evaluated, with caps on some of the immigration channels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "\n\nThousands of Peruvians took to the streets again on Saturday in rallies against President Manuel Merino, while his interim government continued to defend

growing more intense by early evening.\nEarly in the day, in the central Plaza San Mart\u00edn, hundreds of mostly young protesters unveiled a massive Peruvian flag and sang the national anthem. Later, a band of hooded protesters confronted police, throwing rocks and fireworks at them, and security forces fired back with tear gas.\n\n\n\nThe city echoed with sirens, shouts and chants of protesters demanding Merino\u00b4s removal.\nEarlier, Prime Minister \u00c1ntero Flores-Ar\u00e1oz told reporters that Vizcarra\u00b4s removal on corruption charges by the opposition-dominated Congress had been legal. He said Merino had no intention of caving to demands from protesters that he resign.\n\"This was a constitutional change,\" Flores-Ar\u00e1oz said. \"We ask people for understanding. We don\u00b4t want to descend into chaos and anarchy.\"\nEarlier this week, some of the largest protests in decades roiled Peru\u00b4s capital, with dozens injured in clashes between protesters and security forces.

He has called for calm and promised to stick with a plan for presidential elections in April.\nVizcarra, a politically unaffiliated centrist who is popular with Peruvians, oversaw an anti-graft campaign that led to frequent clashes with Congress in a country that has a history of political upheaval and corruption.\nThe former president has yet to be found guilty of the corruption charges brought against him during the impeachment hearing prior to his ouster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "\n\nA judge on Saturday rejected the White House's limitations on a program protecting 700,000 so-called \"Dreamers,\" undocumented migrants brought to the United States as children.\nThe federal judge in New York ruled that President Donald Trump's acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf was not lawfully serving in his role when he issued the new rules for the DACA program in July.\nThe ruling is another victory for proponents of the Barack Obama-era program after the US Supreme Court in June rejected Trump's cancellation of it.\n\n\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden, who defeated Trump in the Nov. 3 polls, had pledged to reinstate the program when he takes office on Jan. 20.\nWolf, who has not been confirmed in his role by the US Senate, issued new restrictions on the program in response to the Supreme Court ruling.\nSaturday's court decision said his restrictions \"effectively suspended\" DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, while the Trump administration reviewed how to proceed.\nWolf's rules said new applications would not be accepted and renewals would be limited to one year instead of two.\n\n\n\nThey are now invalid because \"the court holds that Mr. Wolf was not lawfully serving as Acting Secretary of Homeland Security under the Homeland Security Act\" when he issued them, the ruling said.\nJudge Nicholas Garaufis said the correct order of succession had not been followed for the acting secretary appointment.\nIt was not the first time Wolf has seen the legality of his appointment as acting secretary in 2019 drawn into question.\nTrump entered office promising to halt almost all immigration and to expel the more than 10 million people estimated living in the country, many for decades, without legal immigration documents.\nThe Obama administration sought to address the issue in 2012, with the DACA policy offering protection at renewable two-year periods, including authorization to work, to people brought into the United States illegally as children and then growing up here.\nDACA, and the subsequent DAPA program - Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents - were executive actions by Obama to eliminate the constant threat of deportation for more than four million undocumented migrants.\nTrump canceled DAPA just after coming to office and then went after the more established DACA, but immediately faced a series of court battles over it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "\n\nThe death toll from the deadliest cyclone to hit the Philippines this year has climbed to 67, with 12 people still missing, the national disaster management agency said on Sunday.\nPresident Rodrigo Duterte was scheduled to fly to the northern Tuguegarao province later in the day to assess the situation in Cagayan Valley region, which was heavily flooded after Typhoon Vamco dumped rain over swathes of the main Luzon island, including the capital, metropolitan Manila.\nTwenty-two fatalities were recorded in Cagayan, 17 in southern Luzon provinces, eight in Metro Manila, and 20 in two other regions, said disaster agency spokesman Mark Timbal.\n\n\n\nTwenty-one people were injured, he said.\nMany areas in Cagayan, a rice- and corn-producing region of 1.2 million people, remained submerged as of Sunday, according to media reports.\nHeavy flooding, caused by the accumulated effects of previous weather disturbances, as well as water from a dam and higher plains affected thousands of families, some of whom had fled to rooftops to escape two-story high floods.\nThe damage to agricultural commodities due to floods was initially pegged at 1.2 billion pesos ($25 million), while infrastructure damage was estimated at 470 million pesos, Timbal said.\n\n\n\nNearly 26,000 houses were also damaged, he said.\nRelief and rescue operations continued while the nearby Magat Dam was still releasing water, two days after releasing a volume equivalent to two Olympic-size pools per second, based on government data.\nVamco, the 21st cyclone to hit the Philippines this year, tore through Luzon late on Wednesday and caused the worst flooding in years in parts of the capital.\nIt followed Super Typhoon Goni, the world's most powerful storm this year, which brought heavy rain to southern Luzon provinces and killed scores of people just a few days earlier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "\n\nVillagers outside of Nagorno-Karabakh set their homes on fire Saturday before fleeing to Armenia ahead of a weekend deadline that will see some disputed territory handed over to Azerbaijan as part of a peace agreement.\nResidents of the Kalbajar district in Azerbaijan, which has been controlled by Armenian separatists for decades, began a mass exodus this week after it was announced that Azerbaijan would regain control on Sunday.\nFighting between the separatists backed by Armenian troops and the Azerbaijan army erupted over the breakaway Nagorno-Karabakh region in late September and raged for six weeks.\n\n\n\nArmenia said Saturday that 2,317 of its fighters were killed in the clashes, an increase of nearly 1,000 deaths from its previous official toll.\nAzerbaijan has not revealed its military casualties.\nBut Russian President Vladimir Putin said Friday the number killed in the conflict was higher than 4,000 and that tens of thousands of people had been forced to flee their homes.\nIn the Kalbajar village of Charektar, on the border with the district of Martakert which will remain under Armenian control, at least six houses were on fire Saturday morning, with thick plumes of smoke rising over the valley, an AFP journalist saw.\n\n\n\n\"This is my house, I can't leave it to the Turks,\" as Azerbaijanis are often called by Armenians, one resident said as he threw burning wooden planks and rags soaked in gasoline into an empty house.\n\"Everybody is going to burn down their house today...

The president-elect has largely ignored Trump's repeated claims of fraud, instead focusing on preparing to govern and fielding congratulatory calls from world leaders.\nDuring a bike ride on Saturday morning with his wife, Jill, he answered \"yes\" when a reporter asked whether he was making progress in selecting his Cabinet appointees.\nDespite his bluster on Twitter, Trump began to sound doubtful about his prospects for the first time on Friday, telling reporters \"time will tell\" who occupies the White House starting on Inauguration Day, Jan. 20.\n\"This administration will not be going to a lockdown. Hopefully the, uh, whatever happens in the future - who knows which administration it will be? I guess time will tell,\" Trump said during remarks about the coronavirus pandemic at a White House event.\nBiden won 306 votes to Trump's 232 in the state-by-state Electoral College system that determines the winner, according to Edison Research, far more than the 270 required to win the election. He also leads in the national popular vote by more than 5.5 million votes, or 3.6%.\nWith the election results becoming clearer, Trump has discussed with advisers possible media ventures and appearances that would keep him in the spotlight ahead of a possible 2024 White House bid, aides said.\nBut his repeated allegations that the election was \"rigged\" have inflamed his supporters.\n\"Hundreds of thousands of people showing their support in D.C. They will not stand for a Rigged and Corrupt Election!\" Trump wrote on Twitter. Police gave no official crowd size, but witnesses said the number of protesters was far short of Trump's estimate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "\n\nIndonesia has conveyed its hope for a stronger partnership between ASEAN and the United States for years to come, as the partnership can promote peace, stability and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region, Foreign Minister Retno LP Marsudi has said.\nSpeaking on behalf of President Joko \u201cJokowi\u201d Widodo, Retno expressed Indonesia\u2019s hope for a strategic partnership to US National Security Advisor Robert C.

The trading volume of the two parties increased by 39 percent from US$211.8 billion to $294.6 billion.\u201d\nShe went on to say that US investment in the region had increased by 110 percent from $11.65 billion to $24.5 billion. In the energy sector, the US and ASEAN have made a long-term 2021-2025 partnership plan.\nMeanwhile, in the digital economy sector, they have cooperated through capacity-building programs for 4,000 micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME).\nMoreover, Retno said, in the past 10 months, the partnership between ASEAN and the US in health care had also strengthened with the mutual fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "\n\nThe UN called Friday for urgent measures to protect civilians in Mozambique's northeastern Cabo Delgado province, where jihadists are wreaking havoc, warning that the population was \"desperate\".\u00a0\nThe UN rights office said attacks by armed groups had increased in the region in recent weeks, reportedly leaving dozens of people dead and forcing thousands to flee their homes.\n\"The situation is desperate both for those trapped in conflict-affected areas, with barely any means of surviving, and for those displaced across the province and beyond,\" UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\"Those who remain have been left deprived of basic necessities and are at risk of being killed, sexually abused, kidnapped, or forcibly recruited by armed groups. Those that flee may die trying,\" she said.\nJihadists have caused havoc in Cabo Delgado over the past three years, ravaging villages and towns as part of a campaign to establish an Islamist caliphate.\nThe militants have stepped up their offensive in recent months and violently seized swathes of territory, terrorizing citizens in the process.\nOver the past two weeks, there has been a string of attacks in several villages, with witnesses saying homes and public buildings have been burned and dozens of people killed, the UN said, pointing to reports of numerous beheadings and kidnappings.\u00a0\n\n\n\nLast week, suspected militants beheaded over a dozen men and boys participating in a male initiation ceremony, according to local sources.\nThe unrest has killed over 2,000 people since 2017, more than half of them civilians, according to the US-based Armed Conflict Location and Event Data group.\nOver 400,000 others have been displaced by the conflict and sought refuge in nearby towns and cities.\nThe UN rights office said Friday that since October 16 alone, more than 14,000 people had fled by sea and arrived in the provincial capital, Pemba.\nAt least one boat has capsized, killing around 40 people, including children.\u00a0\nThousands of others are meanwhile believed to be trapped in conflict areas, with many hiding in the bush for days, the UN said.\n\"Some areas have been deprived of any humanitarian aid for over six months, as many districts in the north have been effectively cut off from the rest of the province,\" the statement said.\nBachelet stressed that it was \"paramount that state authorities ensure the protection of civilians inside and outside the conflict-affected areas and that humanitarian agencies are guaranteed safe, unhindered access to deliver life-saving assistance and protection.\"\n\"This is particularly crucial given the risk of cholera and the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic,\" she said, pointing out that Cabo Delgado is among the regions most affected by the coronavirus in the country.\nThe rights office also said it had received reports of violations committed by Mozambican security forces in recent years, including extrajudicial killings.\nBachelet called for all such allegations to be investigated and for perpetrators to \"be held to account.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "\n\nSeeking to end a dangerous military standoff in the western Himalayas, India and China are formulating a plan that involves creating no-patrol zones, pulling back tanks and artillery, and using drones to verify the withdrawal, Indian officials say.\nTensions have run high since June, when at least 20 Indian soldiers were killed after being attacked by Chinese troops using rocks and clubs. Indian officials say the Chinese troops had intruded across the disputed border in a remote valley. China said the Indian soldiers' actions had been provocative.\nSince then, the nuclear armed Asian neighbors have deployed tens of thousands of troops on the rugged frontier between India's Ladakh region and the Chinese-held Tibetan plateau, raising the risk of further confrontation even while looking for ways to de-escalate.\n\n\n\nAfter months of fitful progress, the two sides are discussing a staggered disengagement from the high-altitude desert where temperatures have dipped to 18 degrees below Celsius, three Indian government officials said.\n\"We have a firm plan for disengagement on the table, it is being internally discussed on both sides,\" said one of the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation.\nUnder the plan that was shared during a meeting of top commanders last Friday, both sides will pull back from the contested Pangong Tso lake area and establish a buffer zone.\nChinese soldiers will dismantle defense structures on several hilly spurs overlooking the lake and pull back, the officials briefed on the discussions said.\n\n\n\nIndia, which has occupied heights on the lake's south bank, will also withdraw. Both sides will cease patrolling certain sections.\nThe 3,800-km long India-China border is undemarcated, and the two countries went to war in 1962.\nWhile there have been recurrent incidents down the years, troops from both sides have largely abided by a long-standing protocol to avoid firing weapons on the high altitude border, although some warning shots were fired in September.\nIndia's defense and foreign ministries declined to comment on the specifics of the latest negotiations.\n\"When we have something to share, we will share. Discussions are ongoing,\" foreign ministry spokesman Anurag Srivastava said.\nThe three officials said that military commanders from both sides could meet within a week for further discussions on disengagement.\nThere was no immediate comment from China, but the state-controlled Global Times newspaper cited unnamed sources saying a disengagement plan was under discussion where India would first withdraw troops who had \"illegally crossed lines\" south of Pangong Tso.\nFinding a mutually acceptable sequence for withdrawal could be complicated. Indian troops currently occupy heights on the southern shore of the lake, overlooking Chinese positions.\n\"If we empty out from there, there is nothing to negotiate,\u201d a second Indian official said.\nUnder the plan outlined by Indian officials, tanks and artillery that two sides had deployed following the clash in June would be moved back from the frontline.\nThey were also discussing a way to verify the troop withdrawal including the use of drones over the disputed areas at specific times each day, one of the Indian officials said.\n\"If you are going to establish buffer zones, verification is the key to this,\" the official said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "\n\nA facility set up by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the GAVI vaccine group has exceeded an interim target of raising more than $2 billion to buy and distribute COVID-19 shots for poorer countries, but said it still needs more.\nThe GAVI alliance said on Friday that the funds for an advance market commitment (AMC) will allow the COVAX facility to buy an initial one billion vaccine doses for 92 eligible countries which would not otherwise be able to afford them.\n\"We've seen sovereign and private donors from across the world dig deep and help meet this target,\" GAVI chief Seth Berkley told reporters, adding that there was an \"urgent need\" to also finance treatments and diagnostics.\n\n\n\nBerkley said $3 billion was still needed for diagnostics and $6.1 billion for therapeutics by the end of 2020.\nAnother $5 billion will also be needed in 2021 to procure COVID-19 vaccine doses as they come through development and are approved by regulators, GAVI said in a statement.\nUS drugmaker Pfizer and its partner BioNTech, who this week said their experimental COVID-19 vaccine was 90% effective in initial trials, had expressed an interest in supplying doses to the COVAX facility, Berkley said.\n\"We continue to advance negotiations with a number of manufacturers in addition to those we've already announced who share our vision of fair and equitable distribution of vaccines,\" he added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden will win the battleground state of Arizona, Edison Research projected on Thursday, dealing another blow to President Donald Trump's struggling effort to overturn the results of the Nov. 3 presidential election.\nBiden's win in Arizona gives the Democrat 290 electoral votes in the state-by-state Electoral College that determines the winner, more than the 270 needed to claim victory. Biden is also winning the popular vote by more than 5.2 million votes, or 3.4 percentage points.\nWith a few states still counting votes, the electoral math is daunting for Trump. The Republican president has repeatedly claimed the election was marred by widespread fraud, with no evidence to support his assertions. He would need to overtake Biden in at least three battleground states where Biden currently leads by varying margins.\n\n\n\nThe Trump campaign has filed lawsuits challenging the vote counts in individual states, although some have already been thrown out by judges. Legal experts have said the litigation stands little chance of altering the outcome, and state election officials have said they see no evidence of serious irregularities or fraud.\nHand-count audits in more than six Arizona counties, including Maricopa County, where a majority of the state's residents live, found only minor discrepancies, the secretary of state's office reported earlier on Thursday. The audits involve hand counts of a random sampling of ballots.\nThus far, most Republican officials and lawmakers have publicly backed Trump's attempt to contest the election results and declined to recognize Biden as the president-elect.\nBut a handful of Republican senators on Thursday urged the Trump administration to allow Biden to receive intelligence briefings, implicitly acknowledging he could eventually occupy the White House even as they refused to recognize his win.\n\n\n\nThe president-elect traditionally receives such briefings from the intelligence community to learn of threats facing the United States before taking office.\n\"I don't see it as a high-risk proposition. I just think it's part of the transition. And, if in fact he does win in the end, I think they need to be able to hit the ground running,\" Senator John Cornyn told reporters.\nOther Republican senators also said Biden should have access to classified briefings, including Lindsey Graham, a vocal Trump supporter, as well as Ron Johnson, James Lankford and Chuck Grassley.\nThe top House Republican, Kevin McCarthy, opposed the idea.\n\"He's not president right now. I don't know if he'll be president January 20th,\" McCarthy said.\nBiden remained focused on preparing to govern. The former vice president, who is set to become America's second Roman Catholic president, following John F.

home to Islam's holiest sites - has criticized the cartoons, saying it rejected \"any attempt to link Islam and terrorism\".\nIn his speech, Prince Mohammed said he hopes \"the world will stop attacking religious symbols under the slogan of freedom of expression\" as that creates a \"fertile environment for extremism and terrorism\".\nSaudi Arabia, long\u00a0accused of exporting its ultra-conservative Wahhabist Sunni doctrine around the world, is itself a victim of domestic terror attacks.\nPrince Mohammed, who pledged in 2017 to return Saudi Arabia to an \"open, moderate Islam\", has sought\u00a0to roll back the influence of the ultra-conservative religious establishment.\n\"Extremism is no longer tolerated in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia,\" Prince Mohammed said in his speech.\nThe heir to the Saudi throne has curbed the influence of the once-powerful religious police, as he permits mixed-gender music concerts, cinemas and other entertainment options that appeal to a majority young population.\nBut simultaneously, the prince has launched a sweeping crackdown on dissent and free speech, arresting women activists, clerics and journalists as well as royal family members.\nSaudi Arabia is also grappling with a sharp coronavirus-led economic downturn, which has triggered unpopular austerity measures, including the tripling of its value added tax and the suspension of a monthly allowance to state employees.\nWhile acknowledging the \"great pain\" caused by the austerity drive, Prince Mohammed spoke of government efforts to tackle high unemployment and fight rampant corruption.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "\n\nPeruvian interim President Manuel Merino called for calm as he swore his new cabinet on Thursday amid protests that have escalated around the country since the abrupt ouster of former leader Martin Vizcarra\nMerino, whose cabinet was filled with mostly technocrats, accused some \"candidates\" planning to run in 2021 elections of inciting protests that have broken out in Lima and other cities and urged Peruvians to maintain peace.\n\"We respect those who have a dissenting opinion, but we call for calm and responsibility so that any political expression is given within the scope of tranquility and non-violence,\" Merino said in a speech after the swearing-in of his cabinet of 18 officials.\n\n\n\nMerino assumed office on Tuesday after the Andean nation's fractured Congress voted to oust Vizcarra over bribery allegations.

It has decreased in size in recent years as the neighboring countries tightened security cooperation against Islamist-led Sinai insurgents.\nHowever both Israel and Egypt have, in the past, opposed proposals by Washington to reduce US participation in the MFO, whose website lists some 452 Americans among the force's 1,154 military personnel.\nCairo sees the MFO as part of a relationship with Israel that, while unpopular with many Egyptians, has brought it billions of dollars in U.S. defense aid, sweetening the foreign-enforced demilitarization of its sovereign Sinai territory.\nFor Israel, the MFO offers strategic reassurance in a region where allegiances can shift. In a statement of condolence, Israeli Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi described the MFO as \"extremely important ... to maintaining security and stability\".\nThe MFO statement said the helicopter was on a \"routine\" mission when it crashed.

The research center will also provide access to the complete clinical trial report.\u00a0\n\u201cThe publication of the interim results of the post-registration clinical trials that convincingly demonstrate the Sputnik V vaccine\u2019s efficacy gives way to mass vaccination in Russia against COVID-19 in the coming weeks,\u201d Gamaleya Center director Alexander Gintsburg said in a statement made available for The Jakarta Post on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nThe Sputnik V vaccine was developed at the National Research Centre for Epidemiology and Microbiology in Moscow and is currently undergoing phase three clinical trials in Belarus, India and the Uni Arab Emirates, among other countries.\nThe participants will be observed for the next six months before Gamaleya publishes its final report. The Sputnik V vaccine uses two different human adenoviral vectors to enable a strong and long-term immune response after it is administered for the second time.\u00a0\nThe vaccine is claimed to be safe based on more than 250 clinical trials conducted in the past two decades and reports in 75 international publications.\u00a0\nRussian Federation Minister of Health Mikhail Murashko was upbeat about the results of the interim trial that demonstrated an efficient solution to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u201cThe use of the vaccine and the results of clinical trials demonstrate that it is an efficient solution to stop the spread of coronavirus infection, a preventive healthcare tool, and this is the most successful path to defeat the pandemic,\u201d said Murashko.
